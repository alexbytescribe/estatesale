# estatesale

This repo contains a minimal Flutter application for estimating item value at estate sales. It uses Google ML Kit to identify the item through the camera and a stubbed pricing service to provide a rough price suggestion. The UI shows the description, estimated price, and a suggested bargaining price based on your configured margin.

Since this repository only includes the source code, make sure to set up Flutter and the required dependencies on your machine before running the project.
